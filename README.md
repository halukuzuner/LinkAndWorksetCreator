In large scale projects, models are dividing to multiple parts. Linking Revit models into another and arranging worksets for selective loading is time consuming and liable to make mistakes. I cerated two Revit macros. It is tested on Revit 2025. LinkCreator creates links of selected files as origin to origin. WorksetCreator creates worksets for linked files and assings created links to created worksets. It also creates worksets for existing linked models. You can also add prefix to workset names.
